An adventurer (or a car if need be) is wandering through a forest and collecting various tokens
which will be used as collectibles. Through the way, they run into multiple characters at various
roadblocks, who will present them with a riddle. 

If they get the riddle correct, they will be sent down the correct path. If they get it wrong, 
they are sent down a more winding path.

At the end of the game, the user is presented with a point system based on how quickly they 
completed the game, how many tokens they collected and how many riddles they got wrong
